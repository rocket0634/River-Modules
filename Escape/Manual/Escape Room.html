                        <h2>On the Subject of Escape Room</h2>
                        <p class="flavour-text">I've got the key here for your taking. Hopefully you can find out what to do with it.</p>
                        <p>You are stuck in a locked room. Your goal is to unlock the exit. In order to unlock the exit, you must go through a series of steps in order to obtain the proper keys.<br>
						You must carefully analyze your surroundings to find objects and hints that will aid you in escaping the room.</p>
						
						<h4>Rules:</h4>
						<p>This module requires you to not only take note of what you find in the module, but what you can observe from other modules as well. As long as the information is static, any part of the module or the module's manual can be used in aiding your escape.</p>
                        <ul>
							<li>Any object that is hidden behind a puzzle can be obtained after completing a specific module on the bomb. You can use the context clues from the puzzle to determine which module it is.</li>
							<li>There will be at most three objects per room that will be used to solve the module.*</li>
							<li>Up to 9 objects can be available in a room at a single time. It will be up to you to use the context clues to know which items are necessary. The number of objects can vary depending on how many modules are included on the bomb.</li>
							<li>Up to three rooms will be accessible on the module. As such, you are guaranteed no more than 9 solves per bomb in order to complete this module. </li>
							<li>If you have less than three modules on a bomb, the objects will be hidden based on edgework instead of another module.</li>
							<li>If multiple of this module appear, rooms will be split between the modules. This will only apply if there are enough modules on the bomb to satisfy the room requirements.** Otherwise, the room solutions will be randomized based on available modules. <b>If rooms are split, you are required to solve them in order.</b> Use the context clues for each room to determine what order they must be solved in.</li>
							<li>Strikes will only be given for specifically incorrect submissions. Interactions that are incorrect will not be given a strike.***</li>

                        <h4>Special Rules:</h4>
						<p>Sometimes, the above rules have exceptions that appear in very special cases. They are as follows:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="str">There may be some objects that are out in the open, not hidden behind a puzzle. These are objects that you must carry with you at all times and may require you to interact with one or multiple puzzles. These objects do not count towards the three required objects to pass each room, nor the limit of nine objects in each room.</li>
							<li class="str">Information attached or next to objects may also be used in the final solution for the module. These also do not count against the three object limit.</li><br>
							<li class="str2">Room Requirements: An extra room will be added for up to every three required objects, however if a room is being split, the first room of each module <i>must</i> have at least three objects each. The modules must also have an equal amount of puzzles in order to properly split.</li>
							<li class="str2">Each module will be allowed three rooms each. As such, splitting will be the only case where you explore more than three rooms before being able to escape.</li><br>
							<li class="str3">Be wary of any flashing objects in the room. Any object flashing a green LED must be interacted with before interacting with any other object- other than those listed in the first exception. Be sure to look around for any flashing LEDs before doing anything else. Any LED that is a solid green <b>must</b> be interacted with as soon as possible. Any LED that is a solid red <b>must not</b> be interacted with at any time. Interacting with anything before a flashing green LED or interacting with the red LED will cause a strike at any time. Solid green LEDs will not strike unless you interact with other LEDs incorrectly. These objects also do not count towards the three objects required for the solution.</li>
