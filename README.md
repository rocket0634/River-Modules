# River-Modules
This is a repository consisting of module ideas I have come up with at one point and may continue on my own. With my current inavailability with internet access, I've decided to leave these ideas out in the open in case anyone would like to get to them before I'm able to.

Note, that while I am away, suggestions and PRs are allowed, and I'll look at them at my earliest convenience.

Please read details in the "Note of Departure" docx file.
