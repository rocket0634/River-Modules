Donec ut ex finibus est egestas.</p>
                        <p>Modules listed here are likely modules I have given up on, or have been taken by some other party over time. With them being obsolete, there's no real reason to continue work with them - but I'd like to share some of the ideas I had originally, in case I can still somehow do them, despite the circumstances. This list will not reflect all ideas I currently have for modules.</p>
						<h3>The Meta Pack</h3>
						<p>A set of modules in relation to creating modules. It could include other modules with a 'meta' atmosphere, but began as an idea with four particular modules in mind:</p>
						<ul>
						<li><b>On The Subject of Concepts</b> [Brainstorming]: This is a module that focuses on cause and effect. Essentially, you'll be given a prompt, and must compare different ideas to this prompt to make a sort of a plot for a story. <br>
						The module "Concept of Concepts" is currently being developed by JoketteWuzHere. Its functionality focuses more directly on KTaNE. The name for this module if it comes back will be <b>On The Subject of Brainstorming</b>.</li>
						<li><b>On The Subject of Modeling</b> [3D Models]: This is a module where you are given particular shapes and must place them in a specific way on the module. You will be given points based on the placement of the shapes on the module. Meeting the goal of points will solve the module. For a reference, look up Super Mario Odyssey Picture Match.</li>
						<li><b>On The Subject of Programming</b>: Not much thought has gone into this one, but it seems Blananas2 already has this module taken care of.</li>
						<li><b>On The Subject of Testing</b> [Beta Testing]: You will be given a module (or game) of a random design and your job is to basically make sure everything works. If there are any issues with the module, you must report it. If there are no issues, you can pass the module. Sometimes the pass/report buttons are messed with by the designers, so you will have to find where the proper report button is before selecting anything. Sometimes this is intentional, but most of the time it's accidental. This idea is tangently related to Faulty Modules, some of which are being designed by JoketteWuzHere.
						</ul>

						<ul>
						<li><b>On The Subject of Spelling</b> [Proofreading]: [No Data yet]</ul>
						<h3>Mazes</h3>
						<p>I had a compilation of Maze ideas I was going to work on at some point, but due to circumstances, most of these are likely cancelled.</p>
                        <ul>
						<li><b>On the Subject of Treasure Tracking</b>: This module is based on Mummy Me Mazes from Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. The idea is that you must roam around the map and collect a certain number of coins before you can solve the module. However, there will be three other mummies roaming around the map that you will need to avoid (since it's impossible to emulate having them chasing after you) as well as some enemies you will need to avoid. Essentially, this module is mute because it's basically PacMan, which SpaceScrew is working on.</li>
						<li><b>On the Subject of Don't Look Back</b>: Another take on Treasure Tracking where your goal is to step on all of the tiles on the map without stepping on the same tile more than once. There are alternatives where you need to collect coins or need to avoid enemies while doing so.</li>
						<li><b>On the Subject of Radar</b> [Metal Detector]: The radar is another maze module where your goal is to figure out where you're going based on reading a radar that's on the module. You won't be able to see where you're going, so you will have to trust what the radar tells you.</li>
						<li><b>On the Subject of Sonar</b>: This module is a sound based module where you use echos to decipher how far away something is and use that to find the way to the exit. Due to the nature of sound-based modules on KTaNE, I generally group this as an alternate option for Radar/Metal Detector. Also I may or may not know the actual difference between Radars and Sonars at the time of writing this.</li>
						<li><b>On the Subject of Perplexing Pipes</b> [3D Pipes]: You are given a view of a 3D object with several paths available on the front of it. Each path is a "pipe" and your goal is to figure out where all of the pipes go on the side you cannot see. Essentially, you match the colors of the beginning and end points of the pipes you can see based on what you believe it looks like on the sides you can't see.</li>
